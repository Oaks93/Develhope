            <h3>World consumption</h2>
            <p>Avocado consumption has increased significantly around the world in recent years due to its perceived health
                benefits and versatility in cooking.
                The largest consumers of avocados are the United States and Mexico, with each country accounting for over
                one-third of global consumption.
                In Europe, the demand for avocados has also been growing steadily, with Spain and France being among the top
                importers.
                Despite concerns about the environmental impact of avocado farming, its popularity shows no sign of slowing
                down and is expected to continue to rise in the coming years.

            <h3>Health benefits</h3>
            <p>
                Heart health: Avocados are rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which can help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.
    
                Digestive health: The fiber content in avocados can promote healthy digestion by preventing constipation and maintaining regular bowel movements.
                
                Skin health: The high levels of vitamin E and C in avocados can help protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals and promote healthy skin.
                
                Nutrient absorption: Avocados are a good source of healthy fats that can enhance the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin A, D, E, and K, as well as antioxidants, from other foods.

            <h3>Production</h3>
            <p>Avocado production is concentrated in certain regions of the world, with Mexico being the largest producer, followed by Peru, Chile, and the United States.
    
            Avocado trees require specific growing conditions, including well-draining soil, warm temperatures, and ample water, which makes them suited to specific regions.
            
            Avocado production can have significant environmental impacts, particularly with regards to water usage and deforestation, which has led to concerns about the sustainability of the industry.
            
            Avocado production is often carried out by small-scale farmers, particularly in developing countries, who face challenges related to access to capital, technology, and markets.</p>
